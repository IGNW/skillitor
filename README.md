# Skillitor
Modular skill-tracking microservice

## Intra-service Communication


Weâ€™ll use gRPC to define the message protocol between any microservices. This will allow us to have a well-defined service interface that we can generate server/client code for automatically, and we can use any programming language. There is also a grpc-web Javascript library for web clients.

To communicate with Slack, you can define slash commands and then specify a HTTP endpoint to which Slack will POST whatever was entered after the command. We built an API gateway in Python that relays information between Slack (HTTP) and skillitor-core (gRPC).

Consul provides service discovery, and secure communication between services.
